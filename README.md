# PlingPlangPlong

**Project Goal**
The goal of this project was to produce an application that outputs a particular string dependent on how many factors out of 3, 5 and 7 that number has. More specifically, for a factor of 3, "Pling" was appended to the output, for 5 "Plang" was appended and finally for 7 "Plong" was appended. As such, numbers with multiple factors would expect an output which was a combination of these words concatenated together. SpecFlow was employed to achieve a full coverage of testing for this application, ensuring that positive and negative numbers were tested alongside the number 0.
